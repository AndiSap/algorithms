### Search algorithms
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Continuous and non-continuous substring

### Sorting algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort (last element as pivot)
- sort array where elements are k-positions away from their sorted location in O(nlogk)
- find k-th largest element in unsorted array

### Tree data structure
- Binary Search Tree
    - Create and traverse BST
    - Depth BST
    - Diameter BST
- Minimum Heap

### String data structure
- Is string subsequence of another string (recursive)
- Longest subsequence where every character appears at-least k times (iterative)
- Longest common subsequence with permutations allowed (iterative)
- Anagram Substring Search (Searches for all permutations of pattern in text) - (recursive and iterative)


### Graph data structure and algorithms
- Matrix to Adjacency list conversion
- BFS (matrix and adjacency list)
- DFS (matrix and adjacency list)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (matrix version)
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (matrix version)

### Greedy algorithms
- Factorial Knapsack
- Coin change
- Fuel reloading (gas station)
- Huffman encoding
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Least Recently Used queue
- Minimum spanning tree

- Minimum positive sum subsequence
- Partition equal subset sum and calculate set A and set B members

### Dynamic programming
- Edit distance
